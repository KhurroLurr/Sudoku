# Sudoku
Sudoku program written in C

Program written in the fall of 2015

This program takes an input file of a sudoku game answer and determines
if it is a correct answer. Rules for sudoku can be found here 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

Given that the input files follow the correct format, the program can be
run by compiling with gcc and then running the commands:
./a.out < input.txt > output.txt
